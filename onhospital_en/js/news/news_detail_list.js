                'Hearing loss can be largely divided into conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss, but it is difficult for patients to accurately distinguish their own hearing loss. Diagnosis is made through examinations such as medical history and hearing tests, and treatment varies depending on the type of hearing loss.',
                'Sudden hearing loss is sensorineural hearing loss that has occurred within 3 days of hearing loss of 30 dB or more in 3 or more consecutive frequencies in pure tone audiometry.',
                'It is sometimes accompanied by ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of fullness in the ears (ear fullness), or dizziness. In most cases, no specific cause can be found, but the prognosis is good with early detection and appropriate treatment.',
                'Lee Il-woo, director of OTOLARYNGOLOGY at ON Hospital in Busan, said, “1/3 of patients with sudden hearing loss regain normal hearing, but the remaining 1/3 partially recovers but loses hearing, and the remaining 1/3 completely loses hearing.” It is necessary to conduct appropriate symptomatic treatment, check the patient`s condition well, and actively treat it.”',
                'Tinnitus is a state in which you feel that you hear a sound in the absence of an external auditory stimulus. If you listen to the history and remove the cause, the symptoms will improve. In very rare cases, tinnitus may occur due to an auditory nerve tumor or cerebellar pontine tumor.',
                'Manager Lee Il-woo emphasized, “The cause of tinnitus is unclear, so there are few people who persistently go to the hospital.”.'

                'ON Hospital`s high-tech surgery team announced on the 13th that it had successfully performed surgery on liver cancer patient A (94) last month. He is known to be the oldest among patients who underwent liver resection. Initially, Mr. A’s liver CT and PET-CT (positron emission tomography) tests revealed liver cancer cells with a diameter of 8 cm. The hospital was reluctant to undergo surgery because of Mr. A’s advanced age, but considered the cardiopulmonary function to be good and the extreme pain of terminal cancer if left unattended, they went into surgery. Mr. A, who has been one month after the operation, is living in a general hospital room without any pain.',
                'This team also succeeded in the operation of stage 4 pancreatic cancer patient B (female, 40) suspected of liver metastasis and superior mesenteric vein invasion. Pancreaticoduodenal resection (Whipple operation) and liver resection, which is called the `flower of surgery`, were performed at the same time to completely remove his cancer cells. Mr. B is expected to survive long-term through advanced chemotherapy in the future.',
                'Park Kwang-min, head of the high-tech surgery team (former head professor at the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Asan Medical Center) said, “Patients with stage 4 pancreatic cancer who are suspected of having infiltrated into the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein must first reduce the size of the cancer with chemotherapy before surgery is possible. However, the actual reduction in the size of the cancer is only 30-40%, and even that causes the cancer to severely adhere to the surrounding tissue due to the inflammatory reaction during the chemotherapy process. ” he pointed out. Team leader Park said, “Nevertheless, for cancer patients with a high degree of difficulty, such as stage 4 pancreatic cancer, receiving chemotherapy after excision surgery as soon as possible can increase the treatment effect. Therefore, it is important for SURGERY doctors to take a positive attitude.” At the same time, he predicted that Mr. B`s surgery could be considered as a groundbreaking treatment for stage 4 pancreatic cancer patients with liver metastasis.',
                'According to the hospital, the high-tech surgery team has succeeded in 20 ultra-difficulty cancer surgeries out of 500 cancer surgeries since March 2020. In addition, this year, it will expand its scope to living donor liver transplantation. To this end, Professor Park Kwang-min, who performed more than 1,000 liver transplants at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, led by Professor Park Yo-han (former Busan Paik Hospital Liver Transplant Center), Professor Moon Gi-myeong (former Pusan ​​National University Yangsan Hospital Liver Transplant Center), pancreatic biliary surgeon Lee Sang- yeop, Head of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery Dept, etc. have come together. Recently, infection medicine and department ofRESPIRATORY MEDICINESenior professors are recruited to prepare for perfect liver transplantation.',
                'ON Hospital also introduced `digital PET-CT` for the first time in Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam to activate the operation of the high-tech surgery team, enabling early diagnosis of various microscopic cancers. This equipment is very effective not only for cancer diagnosis, but also for early diagnosis of Parkinson`s disease and torticollis dementia, so it is expected to be of great help in the treatment.',
                'Kim Dong-heon, director of ON Hospital (former director of Pusan ​​National University Hospital and surgeon), said, “This year, we have secured a number of DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY specialists who are capable of brain surgery and cerebrovascular intervention, enhancing our ability to respond to essential emergency medical care. In addition, by expanding to a total of 720 beds, including 10 negative pressure rooms and 36 beds in the intensive care unit, ON Hospital, which is celebrating its 13th anniversary, has grown to a level where it can stand shoulder to shoulder with university hospitals.” Director Kim also pledged to fulfill its role as a hub hospital in Busan by taking the lead in strengthening essential medical services and coping with infectious diseases.'

                'If you can`t chew food properly because you don`t have teeth, saliva is not secreted and food that is not broken into small pieces puts a lot of pressure on the stomach, which can easily lead to indigestion and nutritional imbalance. According to a Japanese research team, teeth also affect cognitive function. When 1,167 elderly people aged 70 or older were surveyed, the group with normal cognitive function had 14.9 teeth, whereas the group with dementia had 9.4 teeth. It is estimated that the act of chewing food also affects the cognitive function of the brain.',
                'If the `teeth` that play such an important role and function are lost, dentures or implants, which can replace the role of teeth, must be treated. Dentures and implants each have their pros and cons, so they are progressed according to the patient`s condition. Many people use dentures because of their economic advantages.',
                'A `denture` is a dental prosthetic that is inserted into the mouth and removed in order to masticate when teeth and gums are lost and to recover aesthetic deficits. Dentures are very important in maintaining the shape of the face by maintaining the shape of the face by restoring the lips that have been rolled due to missing teeth, allowing them to chew food properly when teeth are missing, and to be able to pronounce properly. Therefore, it is important to know how to properly use and care for your dentures.',
                'Busan ON Hospital DENTISTRY Euijeong Lee (DENTISTRY specialist) said, “It is more important than using dentures to care for them after use.” Therefore, you should visit the DENTISTRY once every six months to check if there are any uncomfortable parts,” he explained.',
                'For those who have difficulty moving or cannot visit a hospital, a cream-type adhesive that helps attach dentures can be used. It is a one-time product that can be worn for a day and then washed off. It has staying power to prevent food from getting caught between the denture and the roof of the mouth, and it is also a great help for masticatory function. However, it is difficult to see it as a solution in the long run.',
                'To clean your dentures, you often use regular toothpaste or boil them in boiling water, which should be avoided. This is because toothpaste contains abrasives, which cause fine scratches on dentures and wear, which can cause dentures to not fit well and bacteria to propagate in the tiny gaps. This is because heating can change the shape of the denture.',
                'Dr. Euijeong Lee (DENTISTRY specialist) said, “Especially at night, many people forget to sleep with their dentures on. This increases the propagation of bacteria and accelerates the sinking of gum tissue, so it is absolutely forbidden.” It is better to use detergent or a denture brush, or use a denture cleaner that can be purchased at a pharmacy and soak it in a glass of water,” he emphasized.'
